# ModelScope Skills

**English** | [中文](README_ZH.md)

ModelScope Skills equip AI agents with the ability to operate on ModelScope — model/dataset management, Studio deployment, MCP service configuration, and Skills Center operations. It serves both ModelScope sites: the domestic site [modelscope.cn](https://modelscope.cn) and the international site [modelscope.ai](https://www.modelscope.ai). Compatible with Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and other major coding agent tools.

This repository follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) standard format.

> [!NOTE]
> Start by installing [`ms-hub`](skills/ms-hub/SKILL.md) — the unified entry point for the entire ModelScope platform, enabling your agent to perform most platform operations via the `ms` CLI, Python SDK, and OpenAPI.

## Available Skills

| Name | Description | Docs |
|------|-------------|------|
| `ms-hub` | Unified operations hub — model/dataset search/download/upload, repo management, Studio quick-ops, MCP services, Skills Center | [SKILL.md](skills/ms-hub/SKILL.md) |
| `ms-studio-deploy` | Deploy local projects to Studios (Gradio / Streamlit / Docker / static), API-first workflow with auto-diagnosis | [SKILL.md](skills/ms-studio-deploy/SKILL.md) |

> MCP service management and Skills Center publishing are now folded into `ms-hub`: common ops live in SKILL.md §8/§9, with depth in `ms-hub/references/mcp-services.md` and `skills-center.md`.

## Installation

### ModelScope CLI (universal)

```bash
pip install modelscope
modelscope skills add @ModelScope/ms-hub
# If the modelscope/ms entrypoint has no `skills` command (shadowed by modelscope_hub), use the more reliable:
# curl -fsSL https://modelscope.cn/skills/install.sh | bash -s -- @ModelScope/ms-hub
```

Skills install to `~/.agents/skills/` by default, where major agent tools auto-discover them.

Alternatively, install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope-skills.git
cp -r modelscope-skills/skills/ms-hub ~/.agents/skills/
```

### Cursor

Copy the skill folders from `skills/` into your project's `.cursor/skills/` directory; Cursor auto-discovers the SKILL.md files there.

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add modelscope/modelscope-skills
/plugin install ms-hub@modelscope/modelscope-skills
```

### Codex

Copy or symlink skill folders into `$HOME/.agents/skills` (or `$REPO_ROOT/.agents/skills`).

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope-skills.git --consent
```

## Usage

Once installed, just tell your agent what you need:

- "Download Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct"
- "Deploy this project to ModelScope Studios"
- "Find a map MCP service and configure it in Cursor"
- "Publish my Skill to the Skills Center"

The agent automatically loads the relevant Skill and executes.

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install modelscope
export MODELSCOPE_API_KEY="your_token"   # from the target site's /my/myaccesstoken
# Optional — pick a site (default: domestic modelscope.cn):
export MODELSCOPE_ENDPOINT="https://www.modelscope.ai"   # international; omit for domestic
```

## Sites (domestic / international)

ModelScope runs two sites with separate accounts, tokens, and catalogs:

| Site | Endpoint (`MODELSCOPE_ENDPOINT`) | Token page |
|------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| Domestic (default) | `https://modelscope.cn` | https://modelscope.cn/my/myaccesstoken |
| International | `https://www.modelscope.ai` | https://www.modelscope.ai/my/myaccesstoken |

`MODELSCOPE_ENDPOINT` reroutes the OpenAPI base, CLI, SDK, and git URLs in one shot. Access tokens are **site-scoped** — use the token issued by the site you target. The skills detect the intended site from `MODELSCOPE_ENDPOINT` / your token / explicit intent and default to the domestic site when unspecified. See [`ms-hub`](skills/ms-hub/SKILL.md) → "Site selection & endpoint routing".

## Skill Architecture

```
ms-hub (unified entry / quick reference)
 ├── Hub model/dataset/repo operations
 ├── MCP service search·deploy·configure  → references/mcp-services.md
 ├── Skills Center search·install·publish  → references/skills-center.md
 └── ms-studio-deploy (full Studio deployment workflow, API-first)
```

`ms-hub` covers common operations as quick-reference commands; MCP and Skills Center depth lives in references, while the multi-step Studio deployment is split out into `ms-studio-deploy`.
